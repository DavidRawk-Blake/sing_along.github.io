The Vampire’s Trick-or-Treat Night

A vampire named Vlad, with a cape so wide,
Went trick-or-treating on Halloween night.
With fangs that gleamed and eyes that shone,
He knocked on doors, all on his own!

“Trick or treat!” he said with a grin,
And out popped candy from the bins.
With a “Thank you!” and a bow, so neat,
He flew away on tiny feet.

No need for blood, he just wanted sweets,
A real vampire, but not for treats that bite!
So off he flew, with a bat’s delight,
Ready to snack on candy all night!
